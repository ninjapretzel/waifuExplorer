# waifuExplorer
better waifu explorer harness for https://waifulabs.com/ using unity so I can bootleg their api without cors

This is a Unity3D project. Version: 2019.1.0f2  
Get Unity: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive


Included Dependencies:  
- https://github.com/Meragon/Unity-WinForms for their very useful optimized file browser  
- https://github.com/ninjapretzel/XtoJSON for JSON parsing

Basically I was frustrated with WaifuLab's web waifu builder. 
- There's no way to go back to previous steps
- It doesn't remember your history, so you lose potential interesting waifus
- It doesn't let you save waifus on disk and re-load them at any time

So I made this to automatically save waifus grabbed.

Works as of 1/13/2020, but word is sigizi is rolling out a new waifu model soonâ„¢ and the API might break.
